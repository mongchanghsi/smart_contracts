# Smart Contracts (Solidity)

This repository serves as my practice to develop smart contracts in solidity. Each of these contracts are independent unless I grouped them in sub-folders. Some of the contracts are either followed closey to existing tutorials or inspired by some of them, in which it is credited below.

`Todo.sol` is inspired from a tutorial series by [LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io/courses/c1d7081b-63a9-4c6e-b35c-9fcbbad418b2/lessons/18dad5bd-3a51-4d2e-944e-db37edd74855)
